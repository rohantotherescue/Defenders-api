# Defenders-api
REST API about Marvel's Defenders

PS: I used json-server here to create a fake REST API (cuz I wanted to make this project soo badly and also was running late for a date.)

Install json-server locally: >npm i json-server

Watch your json file: >npx json-server --watch ./db.json

Then click on the resource link (what you basically do is that you send a GET request to that endpoint.)

GGWP!
